##### First of all , my name is bisan , I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Al-Balqa Applied University. Throughout my studies and my experience as a Frontend Developer, I have acquired many skills in creating and designing websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe that teamwork is crucial for achieving good results and reaching goals in the workplace. Effective time management is essential for completing tasks. Additionally, I am confident in my ability to improvise during presentations and effectively communicate with others, as well as my ability to learn in a fast way and work at the same time.

##### what i learned from the first article that every successful developer should have a many of things to be successful like :
1) Lifelong Learning .
2) Break Down Big Problems .
3) Debug Like a Detective .
4) Adopt a Growth Mindset .
5) Focus on Value, Not Just Code .
6) Keep It Simple .
7) Make Thoughtful Trade-offs .
8) Plan for Maintenance .

##### and in the end is should to know that being a great developer isn’t just about code, it’s about how you think, learn, solve problems, and work with others.

##### about the second articl, Terminal commands are useful for developers and tech professionals because they offer power, speed, and control that you often can't get through graphical interfaces (GUIs), and there is a lot of examples that make the work easier and more flexbilty like : pwd, mkdir, ls, cd ...etc
